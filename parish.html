                  <li>Inspired by The Smiths, Lambchop and Tindersticks, the released a critically acclaimed debut, “Paradise Is Pocket Sized” some years ago and have ever since been releasing new music and playing the London pub scene and clubs.</li>

              <h2>Brand and UI Design</h2>
              <p>Branding is important to be reflected in the typography that is chosen. For this project we came up with the following brand adjectives:</p>
              <ul class="split-column">
                <li>Creative &nbsp;&nbsp; Earthy &nbsp;&nbsp; Elegant &nbsp;&nbsp;

                <li>Vintage &nbsp;&nbsp; Clean &nbsp;&nbsp; Humble &nbsp;&nbsp; Reflective</li>
                <li>Retro &nbsp;&nbsp; Human &nbsp;&nbsp; Intelligent &nbsp;&nbsp; Well-Crafted</li>

            <div class="fonts">
              
              <div class="font flow-content-small">
                <p class="font-p">With the brand in place I needed to reflect this in the typography and I decided on the following two fonts:</p>
                <h4>Playfair Display
                </h4>
                <ul class="split-column">
                  <li>I wanted a font that looked similar to the font in the logo and
                    this one matches well!</li>
                  <li>It gives off the vintage/retro feel to it which represents the band.</li>
                  <li>It’s a modern serif and only applied to the headings.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div class="font flow-content-small">
                <h4>Fira Sans</h4>
                <ul class="split-column">
                  <li>Fira Sans for any other text.</li>
                  <li>Fira Sans I feel represents a clean and simple vibe but with hints
                    of human, warmth and elegance which is what the band is about.</li>
                  <li>Humanist Sans serif font that feels simple and clean.</li>
                  <li>It works well as a good body font as it got a high X-height, got all the weights and Itallics.</li>
                </ul>

                  <h3>Medium brand, how did I decide which fonts to use?</h3>
                  <p>I feel that this band’s brand needs to be more than neutral or low brand as it’s important to convey that on the one hand they represent elegance, humanity and warmth but on the other hand they also have a 
                    strong vintage and retro vibe to their brand.</p>
                  <p>I came to the conclusion that this website is suited for a medium brand. It has some branding but there is no need to ‘overdo’ it with too many textures or character as you seen in high branded products.</p> 
                  <p>To achieve a medium branded website I need two fonts that match each other more rather than two that don’t.</p>
                  <p>A good way to test this is to match skeletons of the two fonts to see if they have similar overall outline, shapes and letterforms:</p>

                  <p class="typo-info">Fira Sans put on top of Playfair Display. Both aligned to the baseline and the x-height. I adjusted the letterspacing of Fira Sans so you can compare them more easily.</p>

                    <li>On closer examination you can see the the basics shapes of both are quite similar with short descenders, slightly condensed letterforms and a large x-height. </li>
                    <li>The skeletons of both match well so they would definitely fit into the category of medium branding. If they didn’t match the brand for this pairing would be higher.</li>

                <h2>Annotations</h2>
                <p >When  I always ask myself what is the purpose of the design. A way of defining a hierarchy that will guide the user to push a button is to annotate or add strips that help define the individual user journey visually from top to bottom.</p>
                <p>It's also a good way to make sure a particular design contains everything it should.</p>
